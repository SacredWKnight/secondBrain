# first time feeling truly [[disappointed]] with myself
https://twitter.com/nobu_hibiki/status/1337119294438588416?s=20

i think today is the first time i've ever been disappointed with my self for a very, very long time. i done failed to do plenty of things in the past few years, but none of them ever felt like a... disappointment.

i've adopted the [[mindset]] that there is always things to learn upon from an [[experience]], and that sometimes failure is just a matter of circumstances. disappointment is not the feeling that i should be feeling, any failure should be handled with warm hugs.

but this? jeez what a terrible paper. i tried writing something about how the [[digital economy]] can help get indonesia out of the [[middle income trap]], then it tranformed into how the digital economy is a every part of the economy, to oh wait its the [[third industrial revolution]].

i... am ashamed to even say that this is my writing, and am disappointed that this is the first output i was gonna make for [[progresa]]. mostly disappointed because i keep putting it off and not doing proper [[research]], but also for not [[communicating]] how i feel.

i guess the weird thing is how much i don't like communicating this kind of stuff for [[professional work]]. i guess it's just me being scared to face [[repercussion]] because I REALLY WANT TO PERFORM HERE. again, expectation fails me.

i feel a strong compulsion to talk to someone. talk, not chat. it is 3am, and i do not know how to handle this. no. i do know how to handle it. i just need to face it head on. which means taking the damage and taking the brunt of it.

to: [[rama]], [[faris]], and peps over at progresa. sorry for disappointing you. i'll try to do better next time.
