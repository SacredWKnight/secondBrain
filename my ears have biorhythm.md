i think my ears have a [[biorhythm]] that change which frequencies it focus on. one day i might be totally focused on the melody while other days might be focused on the bass of the song. sometimes it might also focus on instruments. could be the guitar, voice, or maybe drums.

usually helps when i'm bored with a song, it allows me to appreciate a new part of the song that i might have never listened to. very cool ears, very cool
