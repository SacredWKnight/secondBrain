# Manifesto For Life
The Goal, is to live a good life.
Whatever that may be.

This is a Manifesto For Live. Mine. One that is based on the 20 years of life that I have lived in, for which the fundamentals have been set, and the future that exist in front of me. It is based upon the two fundamental concept that have defined who I am, [[spirituality]] and [[education]], mixed together into the exploration that comes after with the [[self]].

*The True, The Good, The Beautiful.*
**Ethics, Logic, Aesthetics.**

In live, you must not disregard and pedestalize one over the other, for the unbalanced self will bring ruin not just to the person, but also the things we create. Let's explore it.

## Spirituality
[[spirituality|Spirituality]], **Ethics**, or The Good. Mine was based of the first ten years of my live, a beautiful time within the *House of Eden*. 

Literally. 

Born in the cult/religious community named [[Eden]], I spent the first ten years of my live surrounded by people who believe that the doctrine of modern religion has shifted from it's original goal. Just kidding. I was barely ten when my parents were "kicked out". I don't have a clue what the tenets of Eden was, I was a kid. However, that doesn't mean I didn't get the **core teaching** and **energy** that was there. Mystical? Yes. 

> The world, is a mystical place. It would do you more service to tune yourself to the **energy** or *vibe* of the universe.

Like Obelix (from the Asterix Obelix comic series), I have been dumped into the mystical super strength potion since birth and have gained super strength from it. In my case, I was surrounded by strong **energy** which cause my **energy** to be like those that have spent time meditating spirituality for years now. I have gained spiritual super strength.

Is it arrogant for me to think this way? Maybe, but I don't care anymore. I have spent too much time worrying about how I might be perceived that I have lied to myself. I was raised in a different environment from a lot of people, it is not out of this world to believe that I... just have a stronger **energy** than most. And it's okay.

With that energy, I slowly learned the **core teaching** that my parents have internalized from [[Eden]].  What were they? I don't know. I can't say for sure what they are, because they are not written anywhere. This goes into my understanding of **Ethics** as a part of being. They are not conveyable through the communication method of **Logic**, Language, but they must be conveyed through *acts*, or as I prefer to call them [[laku]]

> [[laku|Laku]] /laÂ·ku/, is an Indonesian word that describe action, movement, acts. In this context, it describes the process of learning and communication through the implicit acts of a person, fully embodying what they consider to be The Good or **Ethics**. 
> 
> [[spirituality|Spirituality]] and **Ethics** is not a tool for *logical thought experiments*, for it is devoid of any [[laku]] that is necessary for it to be conveyed properly.

Therefore, what does it mean to be **good**? What is **Good** and what is **Evil**? 

I... do not have the answer to that, for **language** is not a sufficient way to convey those values. Only in the moment, when one must *me[[laku]]kan*, can we decide if what we have done is **Good** or **Evil**.

Corny as it may seems, I do believe in the phrase *"Believe in your Heart"*, because it is the only way to know for certain. To **be good**, is to **do good**. And to **do good**, one must have a strong connection to their *conscience/hati nurani*. And to have a strong connection to their *conscience/hati nurani*, one must be in tune with the **Energy** of the universe 

> This is the Core of [[spirituality|Spirituality]]. 
> 
> One must be in tune with the **Energy** of the Universe
> Once in tune, one must **[[laku]]** or **do good**
> Only then, can one **be good** 

## Education
[[education|Education]], **Logic**, or The True. The center of my youth, shaped through my experience as a [[homeschool|homeschooler]] and a [[self learner]].
