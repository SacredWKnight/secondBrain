# Digital World
### Digital World Divide
based on discussion with [[ollybot]] - [[2021-01-17]]

- The world is divided into two, the *digital world* and the *physical world*.
	- It is important that this distinction is understood because due to the complexity of the *digital world*  it is entirely possible for someone to have two different "personality" in this different world 
		- This view clicked with me with normality of [[@nobu_hibiki|alt accounts]] and [[@yudhistirags_|main accounts]]. Just like in the *physical world* you would "act" differently with different person, on the *digital world* the "act" is conducted through these different accounts
	- The *physical world* is not more **real** than the *digital world*, they are both equally **real worlds** with **real consequences**
- The ability to navigate *both worlds* with proficiency will be paramount in living a live that fully make use of the technology that we have on our hands.
	- A **traditional monk** that only spends it's time meditating in a cave is as detached from the world as an **e-boy** that only spends it's time 100% on the internet 
		- Both are powerful in their own *world*, but they do not have the full ability to understand and resonate with *both worlds*
		- Being able to resonate with both world is my [[future]]
	- How to cultivate a strong resonating connection of both the *digital world* and *physical world*, mixed with all of it's personalities?
		- IDK
		- Probably do what [[visa]] is doing
			- Talk about the process
				- Both the IRL one and the Digital One
			- Keep doing things online the way we do things irl
				- Stop being a [[perfectionist]]
					- Just Do Stuff - [[2021]]
			- Cultivate taste
			- Be true to one self
		- A lot of these is probably things that you would need to do to have a good coherent live in the *physical world* as well, but to be able to do it good in the *digital world* as well probably means acknowledging that maybe we are baby in this digital world and that mucking around is cool.
- The image of the *digital world* is that the Internet is a **City**, and that social media's (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc) are **Clubs**, while services (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, etc) are **Infrastructure Companies**.
	- It is completely understandable when you see it in a *physical world* sense that you could act differently in different **Clubs**, heck even in the same **Club** you could act differently depending on who you're hanging out with.
		- This is the concept of **multiple account** in the *digital world*, and it is important to understand that it is fine to:
			- Have them
			- Not have them
	- It is impossible for people to exist in the **General Internet**, because there is no longer any **General Internet**. Even the most **mainstream** stuff are there only for a certain time, a blip of popularity. And even that doesn't touch *all* facet of the *digital world*.
		- Currently one big thing that is big is the **Sea Shanty** thing, which iirc originated from TikTok. While it's **BIG**, I know for a fact that it does not touch the *digital world* that my parents touch.
	- The idea that the capitalist system push for to create niche that differentiate products (talked a bit on [[@BecomingCritter]]'s podcast with [[@Virtual1nstinct]]) exist not just on the music industry, but also in [[internet culture]] as well.
		- This then reinforce the idea that the *digital world*, just like the *physical world*, is actually malleable. Heck [[everything is malleable]].
			- If you have a certain idea, philosophy, interest, or anything that can bond a group of people, you can create a new set of [[internet culture]]
			- I mean, Pelican TikTok is a thing started by [[Hank Green]] which is WILD
			- And currently the one closest to my online existence is the [[metatribe|ingroup]], which is a group of people that... eh? Not getting into what the fuck ingroup is.
		- This include **who you are** and **what you do**. In the internet, you can create a **better self** and it is **totally fine**.
			- Does this create the possibility of moral hazards?
				- Maybe, but how is it more than what we can already do IRL?
					- The problem is not a **"fake self"**, but a **dissonance between selves that you cannot contain**
						- I say that what you can't contain because people can polar personality and keep it together.
						- Part of my [[bounded chaos]] theory
