> I. WANT. TO. BE. FASHIONABLE!

I have a strong idea of what I want. I want to wear less boring t-shirt and more elaborate stuff. Currently I wear my blanket everywhere, but a robe would probably be the right next move. 

However, [[fashion]] is not cheap. Good quality clothes are expensive especially brand name. Therefore, as part of me learning how to do stuff, why not make it on my own?

I will be embarking in the interesting journey of [[sewing]] and [[clothes making]], with the end goal of making a robe like thing. The image I have in my mind is "kimono batik", which implies a flowing and open robe with batik as their pattern.
