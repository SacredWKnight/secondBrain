# not enough [[mental bankruptcies]]
https://twitter.com/nobu_hibiki/status/1338411790103883783?s=20

this might be the biggest thing that i've lost in the past few months. i haven't been able to declare mental bankruptcies at all. my pile of uni work will still be there even if i declare mental bankruptcies, and that is taking a toll on my mental health.

when i had control on basically all part of my life, i declare bankruptcy at every [[sleep]]. used to call it \*almost [[ego death]]\* though. a part of me that worries or think about that dies, and a new me capable of thinking again is born.
