honest just realised i was raised in a fairly [[conservative family]]. it never clicked with me due to how [[liberal]] their views on the [[education system]], work, and the dogmatic view of religion. but, their basic viewpoint is very conservative

there's a lot of [[tradition]] and most of the [[personal values]] are actually quite conservative. idk the word of it in english (might translate later), but a lot of [[tata krama]] and [[sopan santun]] very [[javanese]]

they're also conservative on other things. [[relationships]] is one that comes to mind while they never said i can't date, the realm of [[sex]] and any sort of [[sexual exploration]] is a realm strictly for post marriage and while not being fully homophobic, they wouldn't like it if im [[gay]]

i think it's because in a national scale, they're pretty liberal. conservative here in Indonesia mostly means religiously and culturally conservative. but getting to know the world, my self, and my views, i think i would like to be a little bit more liberal than them.

probably will never be as liberal as some, as i actually don't think that most of the conservative values are actually that bad, but there are things i want to try yknow. things like [[shrooms]], sex, the [[night life]], hanging out til late. yknow things cool kids do
