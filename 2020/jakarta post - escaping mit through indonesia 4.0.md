# Escaping the middle income trap through Making Indonesia 4.0? - Opinion

Much attention has been afforded to President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s recent launch of Making Indonesia 4.0, an industrial strategy that chiefly emphasizes harnessing technology to boost growth in tune with the digital era. 
Policymakers, analysts and media outlets have lauded the strategy as a method in which to catapult the economy out of the middle income trap (MIT), with the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas) saying Indonesia will join the high income club by 2045 with gross domestic product per capita of US$29,000.

Indeed, the MIT has been highlighted because of slowing growth, which in 2017 stood at 5.07 percent, lower than the government’s target of 5.2 percent. President Jokowi has asserted that the successful implementation of Making Indonesia 4.0 can push growth to 7 percent. 

The MIT refers to the difficulty middle income countries (MICs) face when transitioning from middle to high income status, illustrated by moving from capital- and labor intensive- (intrinsic) led growth to innovation, technology- and knowledge- (extrinsic) led growth. 

The MIT is dual faceted. On the one hand, MICs at risk of the MIT have often exhausted growth strategies based on intrinsic production, while losing comparative advantage to lower-cost competitors with larger economies of scale, such as China and India. 

Yet policymakers who have seen their countries progress from low to middle income status often try to maintain intrinsic growth strategies, despite competitiveness being eroded by rising wages. 

On the other hand, countries try to leap to extrinsic-led growth without the infrastructure, human capital or institutional foundation in place to make such a transition and compete with higher income technological frontier countries, such as Japan and the United States. 

Thus, progressing through income levels needs to strike a careful balance of upgrading products and processes while simultaneously upgrading the prevailing structural and institutional characteristics of the economy. 

So how does Making Indonesia 4.0 fare? 

It is important to stress that Indonesia has yet to transition to upper-middle income status. 

The World Bank defines GDP per capita of low income economies as $1,045 or less, lower-middle income as below $4,125, upper-middle income as below $12,746 and high income as above the latter figure. 

Indonesia in 2016 had GDP per capita of $3,400 according to World Bank Development Indicators, a drop from its 2013 peak of $3,730, thus categorizing it as a lower-middle income country. 

The figures alone tell us that the country has yet to exhaust its phase of intrinsic production, dubbed the “easy phase of growth”. 

The Jokowi administration appears to have a grasp on this, demonstrated by its push for the rapid development of infrastructure, bureaucratic reform and upgrading human capital, especially that of unskilled workers. 

But as the Indonesian saying goes, bangun pagi biar rejeki lancar (wake up early for good fortune). Making Indonesia 4.0 can lay the groundwork for when Indonesia does eventually come up against the MIT. 

The roadmap, which outlines an industrial strategy from 2018 to 2030, focuses on five industries, namely food and beverages, chemicals, textiles, automotives and electronics. 

As verified by the World Bank and US-based consultancy AT Kearney, the five priority sectors were chosen on the basis of their expected impact and feasibility, rather than on nationalist or idealist aspirations that usually plague industrial strategies. 

Moreover, these sectors absorb vast numbers of workers on low wages. However, with technological advancements, the demand for low skilled workers in these industries is expected to diminish significantly. 

Currently, Indonesia spends a mere 0.3 percent of its share to GDP on research and development, far below its neighbor Malaysia, which spends 1.1 percent, as well as China, which spends 2 percent. Meanwhile, enrollment in tertiary education is also at a lowly 24 percent, whereas Malaysia stands at 44.12 percent and China at 48.44 percent. 

The roadmap acknowledges that addressing this disparity is especially urgent, as the country will see 28 million workers enter the workforce between 2016 and 2030. To make the most of the demographic dividend, this new generation of workers must be skilled and technologically competent. 

By targeting these sectors, the government is thus addressing a wide base in which to prepare skills supply and formation in line with Industry 4.0. What’s more, developing comparative advantage in these sectors will be crucial to raising income levels. 

However, despite the positive provisions of Making Indonesia 4.0, the Jokowi administration must not lose sight of nor spend political capital on diverging from its core programs, namely through developing infrastructure, upgrading human capital and implementing bureaucratic reform. 

Without this structural foundation in place, Making Indonesia 4.0 will not reach its ambition of 7 percent growth nor transition the country to upper-middle income status, let alone high income status. 

Rather than the MIT, the more urgent threat to the economy relates to the government’s populist policies in maintaining fuel and electricity prices through increasing subsidies by $508 million and making state-owned enterprises foot the rest of the bill. 

In 2014, President Jokowi cut fuel subsidies in order to free up billions of dollars for infrastructure and human capital, the development of which is vital to implementing the industrial roadmap effectively. 

Yet this funding could come under threat, because even though the administration has said the subsidies will last until 2019, it will undoubtedly be politically difficult to withdraw given rising global oil prices, which past administrations know only too well. 

If the government can keep its core development strategy on course while avoiding populist economic measures, it is likely that Indonesia will transition to upper-middle income status. 

Having said that, Making Indonesia 4.0 is a step in the right direction and lays some of the groundwork for when the country does eventually come up against the challenges of the MIT.
