# 7.2 Culture and Decentralization
Notes for: [[developments economics]]
___

Using the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], we can say that the welfare is based on the country's **policy** and also **institutions**.

## Culture
Culture takes time to change, usually one generation. One of the most important part of culture is the **social capital**, which includes the **participation**.

## Decentralization
We moved from centralized to a decentralized system in early 2000's. Some even called it a **big bang**. Along with the decentralization, there's a change in the political scene. 

It used to be that local leader was appointed, now local leader is elected. As a developmental economist, we need to see **how that affect the change**. Indonesia is a good case study that change their institutions from centralized to decentralized. 

Two major observation:

1. Most district suffer from **local capture**, where the first priority of the local leader is not to *improve the welfare* of the local people but to *pay back the resources* that was required for them to be in power in the first place (membayar balas budi kepada partai biasanya)
2. Interestingly enough, even if **local capture** happens some district have a *better welfare* while other have *worst welfare*. We think that if everyone gets local capture, the outcome would be the same (economics jargon of **multiple equilibrium**). 

Using *Chart 1* from below, we can start the journey from **Decentralization** to **Welfare**. Every process must go through the **Local Capture**, but the movement from that toward **Welfare** is affected by all the circle there (P, S, Q, F). The question is to see which of the P, S, Q, F is the most important.

The research found that P and Q are the most important. **People's Participation** affected by culture is also important. However in some places the **Quality of Leader** is so good that it can move the P. **Quality of Leader** have a topology (shown in *Chart 2*), which divide leaders to that are able to utilize the funds and also create high participation. 

This shows that decentralization policies are not always good, it depends on the variables. In particular the role of local leaders and the ability for local leaders to mobilize people.

- D = Decentralization
- L = Local Capture
- W = Welfare effect of decentralization
- S = Initial welfare condition
- P = People's Participation
- Q = Quality of Leader
- F = Size of local budget
