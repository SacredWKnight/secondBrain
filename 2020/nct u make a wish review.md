what the actual fuck.
- this song is very u
- there are like 6 time the song change type
- the background whistle is very cool
- the sexual undertones is nice
- why is lucas here
- [[nct 2020|nct]] is super weird
- the song is a bit long
- [[sm]] manages to utilize their box very well
- they use some weird indian motives, not sure how appropriate it is. does feels "exotic" though
- i guess the strong point of a big company like [[sm]] is that their production quality is very high
- what is it with the creepy [[cult]] imageries
- can't wait for reacttothek to react to this and tell me the weird music things because I don't understand
- my boy taeyang is super cool
- is there two bridges?
- why are they so good at [[harmonization]]
- lucas looks like an elf lol
