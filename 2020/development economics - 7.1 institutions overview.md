# Video 7.1 - Overview of Institutions in Developments
Notes for: [[developments economics]]
___

### Sustainable Development review:
- How to **internalize** of [[externalities]]
- No one should be left behind (lowering the gap between classes)
- [[externalities|Externalities]] needs to be handled by governments

Policies when you moved from low income -> medium income, policies cannot stay the same. Here the role of [[institusions]] is important. People participations in implementing and creating policies are important.

## Case: *Decentralization & Local Leader Election*
Hypothesis: Will be better because local people knows how to handle it better
Condition: How the election of local leader can handle [[institusions]]

## Institutions
Two type:
- Formal
- Informal

They create an **Implied behavior** and also provide **enforcment**. 

*How do they affect productivity?*

The way institution affect is through **transaction cost**, which makes it harder to turn human capital into production. A country might have good regulation and policies, with no **enforcement** it is hard to implement them, which causes transaction cost.

*Can we change that institution?*

Yes, but it takes time. Because institutions is affected by cultural factor. Culture here can be defined as:

> Customary belief/values transmitted by "religious" & "ethnicity" groups from generation to generation (evolutionary, slow)

This is the reason why many developing countries with weak institutions have a hard time to change the institution.

==*it takes time for a country to create better institution*==

We will use the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] to evaluate the effect that institutions and culture have on a country.
