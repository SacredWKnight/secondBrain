# SME's and Microfinance
Notes for: [[developments economics]]
**Lecture by:** Professor Ralph D. Christy
____

## Markets:
Due to the [[Washington Consensus]] most of the countries of the world focus on a **market economy** (with only [[Cuba]] and [[North Korea]] not following that) 

## Small and Medium Enterprises 
SMEs are important for development as they are where **the bulk of the economy** is, therefore it is important for us to understand and support them to continue development. One of the biggest problem SMEs face is *large companies entering the market from all over the world*, hogging up all of the attention, which lead to a neglect on small businesses.

Some **strategies** to help SMEs to compete against the bigger companies is by teaching them the best business strategies and the latest economic management tools. However, some challenges comes up when trying to help them do that, such as:
- How do you evaluate progress?
- Does training actually makes a difference?
- High cost of training (makes it hard for small firm to learn from)
- Difficulties in scaling up 

## Why is International Development Important?
- **Capital Growth**: Because developing countries are growing, and many want to invest in developing countries.
- **Public Health**: With our interconnected world it is extremely important that we have good public health for the entire world.
- **Political Reason**: Politics affect the economic
- **Humanitarian Interest**: 

## Microfinance
- **Why?** Because traditional bank doesn't trust poor people to pay back loans because of the **4C**
	- Collateral
	- Cash
	- Credit record
	- Character
- While they don't have the **4C**, most poor people have a **social capital**. They have families, trust, and community.
