### what
One of my [[inner demons]], I feel like I'm always lying all the time. A white lie, nothing drastic that makes me feels like I'm a massive fraud, but a lie none the less. I lie about how I feel, what I am, who I am, what I'm doing. Everything *feels* like a lie.

Using my [[mind palace]] ability, I have managed to gain a grasp on [[reality]] and create my own [[simulation]] of it in my mind. Based on [[theater]] and [[fiction]], I learned how to [[read people]] and put my self in basically anyone's shoes. 

Since I'm capable of using the [[mind palace]] to create [[scenarios]], it always feel like I'm lying since I [[optimize]] who I am depending on who I'm talking with. 

### progress
this tweet from [[miftah]] shows me that [[self-concept]] might just be a tool, and is not actually possible to understand objectively. https://twitter.com/nobu_hibiki/status/1314927479866318848?s=20
