# Chaos
 #potentialArticle
`cha·os /ˈkāˌäs/ noun complete disorder and confusion.`

Sometimes symbolized as  the [[unknown]], [[uncertainty]], [[power]], and [[nature]], [[chaos]] is one of the two fundamental building blocks of reality, and the chaos part of [[bounded chaos]].

### My definition
Chaos is everything that is different. To be chaotic is to not follow in line. To be chaotic is also to [[create]], as creation is the process of creating something new.

Commonly tied to [[chaos]] is [[freedom]].  

### Image of Chaos
My image of chaos from [[fiction]] probably comes from the [[video game]] [[Hades]] or any form of [[demon]] from fantasy as they are usually [[chaos|chaotic]] in nature. 

However, other character also fits the bill of being **chaotic**, such as:
![[hisoka morou]]
