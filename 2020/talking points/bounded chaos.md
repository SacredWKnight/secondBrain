# Bounded Chaos
#potentialArticle
also known as [[balance]], it is the name I gave to the idea that everything in life should be done by this principle. A mix of [[chaos]] and [[order]].

### What is it?
Well it is when you have the [[chaos|chaotic]] energy of the universe, and then bound it by [[order]] and law and all that jazz. An example would be taking the chaotic energy of LIGHTNING and bounding it by the order of copper wires and cables, creating the useful electricity. Another example would be using the boundless imagination of our mind and bounding it by a constraint, allowing us to focus and create a *thing* in reasonable time.

The idea that you should [[balance]] [[chaos]] and [[order]] is a concept as old as time. [[yin-yang]] is probably the most mainstream concept, and is the concept that solidifies it for me. I like [[chaos]] and I like [[order]]. But... media always shows them as opposites things. Order must be brought into the chaotic world, color (chaos in disguise) must take over the colorless world (order in disguise).

However, the world cannot exist without the right amount of both of them. A world of perfect [[order]] would have everything [[equal]], meaning all are the same, realistically probably meant everything is the same atom everywhere. However a world of perfect [[chaos]] would yield a similar idea, everything is different, there are nothing the same, everything is just [[noise]]. Nothing can exist in a world of pure [[order]] or [[chaos]].


### Bounded Chaos in [[fiction|Fiction]]
There are a few character that I would say embodies the idea of bounded chaos extremely well. Here's a few:
