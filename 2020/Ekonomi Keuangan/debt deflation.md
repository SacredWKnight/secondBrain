Imagine a firm with **\$100 million asset** and **\$90 million long-term liabilities**. If the price level falls by 10%, the real value of the asset would **remain at \$100 million**, while the long term liabilities would rise to **\$99 million long-term liabilities.**

The net worth at the start change from **\$10 million** to **\$1 million**
