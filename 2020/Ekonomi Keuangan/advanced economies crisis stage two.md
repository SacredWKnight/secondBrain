# Stage Two: Banking Crisis
Due to the declining [[net worth]], some business reach [[insolvency]]. Unable to pay of their [[debt]], some [[banks]] goes out of business. If severe enough, it can cause [[bank panic]] and cause panic.

People will then take out their [[deposit]], to the point the [[banks]] fail. [[uncertainty]] in the health of the [[banking sector]] can force [[banks]] to sell off [[asset]] quickly to raise funds. Called [[fire sales]], these can actually reduce the price so much that more [[banks]] become [[insolvency|insolvent]] which lead to a full-fledged [[bank panic]].

With fewer [[banks]], information about credit scores disappear, increasing [[adverse selection problem]] and [[moral hazard]]. With no [[capital]] circulating to [[productive investment opportunities]], it leads to a deeper [[financial crisis]]. 

Eventually, the [[insolvency|insolvent]] firms shut down and [[liquidate]], uncertainty in the [[financial markets]] decline, [[bank balance sheets]] improve, and it is time for [[economic recovery]].
