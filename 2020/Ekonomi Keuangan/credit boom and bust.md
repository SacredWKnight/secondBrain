# Path A: Credit Boom and Bust
Happened due to [[mismanagement of financial liberalization and globalization]], it is the reason the [[mexican financial crisis]] and [[east asian financial crisis]] happened.

It happens when a country [[eliminate restrictions]] on [[financial institusions]] & [[markets]], a process known as **[[financial liberalization]]**, which opens up to [[international capital flows]] which is called **[[financial globalization]]**. In the long run, **[[financial liberalization]]** promotes [[financial development]] and encourages a [[financial system|well-run financial system]] that allocates [[capital]] efficiently. However, in the short run it can prompt [[financial institusions]] to do [[risky lending pratices]] and create a **[[credit boom]]**.

## In [[advanced economies]]
[[goverment safety nets]] such as [[deposit insurance]] weakens market discipline and increase [[moral hazard]] incentive to take greater [[risk]]. This is due to the [[lenders]] knowing that [[goverment]] are there to protect them from losses.

Once the losses from [[loans]] begin to increase, the value of the loan falls relative to [[liabilities]], driving down the [[capital|net worth]] of [[banks]] and other [[financial institusions]]. With less capital, the [[financial institusions]] starts cutting back [[lend|lending]], called **[[deleveraging]]**.

Once it hits a point, the [[credit boom]] become a [[credit crash]]. This in turn increase the [[asymmetric information problems]] of [[adverse selection problem]] and [[moral hazard]].

## In [[emerging market economies]]
[[financial liberalization]] and [[financial globalization|globalization]] are not prevalent in [[mature financial system]], so it mostly only affect [[emerging market economies]]'s [[emerging financial system]]. Due to the [[weak credit culture]], [[risky lending pratices]] leads to a huge [[loan loss]].

### Not Inevitable
These events only happen if the [[goverment policies]] is bad. With stong [[goverment policies]] to limit excessive [[risky lending pratices|risk-taking]],  the [[loan loss|lending boom & bust]] will not happen.

Why is it so hard in [[emerging market economies]]? [[principal-agent problem|Principal-agent problem]]. [[politician]] & [[goverment policies]] are usually the agents of [[taxpayer|voters-taxpayers]] (principals). The goal of [[politician]] is to protect the [[taxpayer]]'s interest, which in this case is not letting the [[banking sector]] crash because [[taxpayer]] usually pays the cost of [[bailing out]] the [[banking sector]].

The [[domestic banks]] and [[banking sector]] are much less influental in [[advanced economies]] due to the [[better-educated public]] and [[free press monitor]] to punish [[politician]] and [[goverment]] that is not acting in the [[taxpayer|public interests]].
