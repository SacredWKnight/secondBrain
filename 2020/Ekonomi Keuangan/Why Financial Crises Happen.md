# Why Financial Crises Happen
Well-functioning [[financial system]] solves [[asymmetric information problems]] ([[moral hazard]] and [[adverse selection problem]]) so that [[capital]] is allocated to its most productive uses. These [[asymmetric information problems]], which act as a [[barrier to efficient allocation of capital]], are often described by economists as [[financial frictions]].

With [[financial frictions]], [[financial markets]] are unable to channel funds efficiently to [[household]] and [[firm]] with [[productive investment opportunities]] which results in a [[economic activity|decline in economic activity]].

[[financial crisis]] happens when [[information flow in financial markets]] is [[distrputions|distrupted]] which results in a [[financial frictions|sharp increase of financial frictions]] and the [[financial markets]] stop functioning. Then [[economic activity]] collapses.
