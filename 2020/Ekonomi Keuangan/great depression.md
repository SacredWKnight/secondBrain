# Great Depression

## Information from [[ekonomi moneter]]
##### Book: [[Frederic S. Mishkin - The Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets]]

### U.S. Stock Market Crash
In [[1928]] and [[1929]] the [[U.S. stock prices]] doubled. The [[Federal Reserve]] officials viewed the boom as [[speculation|excessive speculation]]. To curb it, they did a [[monetary policy]] to raise [[interest rates]] in an effort to limit the rise in stock prices. By the end of 1929, the [[stock market]] has crashed by 40%.

### Worldwide Decline in [[asset prices|Asset Prices]]
The crash in the [[U.S. stock prices]] quickly affected other countries. [[arbitrage]] and panic propagated the trend in [[stock prices]] throughout [[advanced economies]]. [[Charles Kindleberger]] however said that:

> “the [1929–1930] depression was a worldwide phenomenon in origin and interaction rather than an American recession that […] spilled abroad."

Worldwide [[commodity prices]] had been declining since the early 1920s. According to some accounts, the average [[U.S. price index]] for a selection of 30 basic commodities decreased from a peak of 231 in 1920 to a trough of 74 in 1932. The decline in commodity prices accelerated after the 1929 [[stock market crash]].

### Bank Failures
The sharp drop in [[stock prices]] together with the decline in [[commodity prices]] put a huge strain on the [[bank balance sheets]] in most [[advanced economies|advanced industrial countries]]. This triggered [[bank panics]], with massive withdrawals from banks in the United States (in 1930–1933), Italy (1930–1931), Belgium (1931), Germany (1931), Switzerland (1931–1933), and Austria (1929–1930). 

Some countries, like France, were relatively spared from a full-fledged [[banking crisis]]—the country registered only two major bank failures in the early 1930s. Others, by contrast, saw banks failing by the hundreds, or by the thousands, such as in the United States, where 1,860 banks failed between August of 1931 and January of 1932 alone. As a result several countries, including the United States and Germany, declared bank holidays.

### Economic Contraction & Debt Deflation
Decline in [[asset prices]] together with [[bank failures]] and panics created [[debt deflation]] which led to [[mass unemployement]] in most [[advanced economies]].
