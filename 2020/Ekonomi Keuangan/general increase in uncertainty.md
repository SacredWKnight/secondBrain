# Increase in Uncertainty
[[financial crisis]] usually starts in [[periods of high uncertainty]], such as after [[the start of a recession]], a [[crash in the stock market]], or [[failure of a major financial institution]]. 

In the [[USA|United States]], the crises began after the failure of [[Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company in 1857]]; the [[Jay Cooke and Company in 1873]]; [[Grant and Ward in 1884]]; the [[Knickerbocker Trust Company in 1907]]; the [[Bank of the United States in 1930]]; and [[Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG in 2008]].

Due to [[uncertainty]], there exist [[asymmetric information problems]], increase in [[financial frictions]], and reducing in [[lend|lending]] and [[economic activity]].
