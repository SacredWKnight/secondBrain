# Stage One: Initial Phase
Two basic path are present that trigger crises in [[emerging market economies]]. The first path, is the most common path.

1. [[credit boom and bust]]
2. [[severe fiscal imbalances]]

## Additional Factors
- [[precipitating factors]] may play a cause, such as in [[mexican financial crisis]] where the [[U.S. monetary policy]] caused an increase in [[high interest rates|interest rate]] and the [[adverse selection problem]] becomes more severe.
- [[asset price decrease]] also affect [[emerging market economies]], even if not as much as [[advanced economies]] due to their size. Because there are less [[collateral]] to collect, it leads to more [[moral hazard]] because there is less to lose with a [[risky lending pratices]].
- [[unstable political systems]] are also problems that [[emerging market economies]] have. When [[uncertainty]] increase, its harder for [[lenders]] to monitor and find good credit, worsening the [[adverse selection problem]] and the [[moral hazard]].
