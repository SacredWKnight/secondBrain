# Asset-Price Boom and Bust
Prices of [[asset|assets]] such as [[equity shares]] and [[real estate]] can be driven by investor [[psychology]], well above their [[fundamental economic values]]. This rise is called the [[asset-price bubble]].

Examples of [[asset-price bubble]] are the [[dot com bubble]] and the [[global financial crisis of 2007-2009|housing bubble]]. [[asset-price bubble]] are often also driven by [[credit boom]] where a large increase in [[credit]] is used to buy [[asset]], driving up their price.

When the [[asset-price bubble]] pop (realign with the [[fundamental economic values]]), [[net worth]] of companies will decline, which mean they will make more [[risky investment]], which is a [[moral hazard]]. Because of that [[financial institusions]] tighten lending standards, while the [[asset]] of [[financial institusions]] also decline which cause them to [[deleveraging|deleverage]], which cause [[economic activity|decline in economic activity]].
