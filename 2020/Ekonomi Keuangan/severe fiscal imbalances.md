# Path B: Severe Fiscal Imbalances
[[innapropriate financing of goverment spending]] can also start the process of [[emerging market economies]] towards financial crisis. [[argentine financial crisis]] was caused due to this, also the [[russian financial crisis]], [[ecuador financial crisis]], and [[turkey financial crisis]].

Just like [[advanced economies]], [[goverment]] in [[emerging market economies]] sometimes cannot [[finance their goverment debt]] and must force [[domestic banks]] to purchase [[goverment debt]]. [[investors]] that lose the confidence that the [[goverment]] can pay the debt, will sell their [[goverment debt|bonds]], lowering the price.

[[domestic banks]] that have this [[goverment debt]] then will lose their [[net worth]] due to the bad [[bank balance sheets]]. With less [[capital]] [[domestic banks]] cannot [[lend]] and lending declines. It is even worse when the decline of [[domestic banks]] [[capital]] cause a [[bank panic]] that cause multiple [[domestic banks]] to fail at the same time. 

[[severe fiscal imbalances]] therefore weakens the [[banking sector|banking system]], creating more [[adverse selection problem]] and [[moral hazard]]
