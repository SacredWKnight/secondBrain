lately have been listening to txt's fairy of shampoo due to [@reacttothek](https://twitter.com/reacttothek)'s video on it, and honestly it is one of the most sexual yet sad song I've heard ever I'm feeling feelies in my jimmies listening to it. The thing I'm missing atm.

honestly not sure what it is. in the [[reaction video]] (which u should totally check out) they point out that it's a [[remake]] of an old song, a song about falling in [[love]] with a girl in a shampoo commercial. which is why the song feels distant

listening to the songs makes me wanna [[cry]]. like for something that i don't have. then again I've been feeling like i wanted to cry for quite a while so it might not be valid but... why does it feel like I'm listening to sadwank the song

definitely want to revisit the song for the a proper review, but i just wanted to say what i was feeling listening to the song. it's like a late night urban feeling, one that i have never felt because i was raised... i guess kinda conservatively? going on tangent now.
