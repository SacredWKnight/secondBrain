> Basically these past two days have highlighted the fact that, nothing is forever! Not my eyes and not [[@nobu_hibiki|my account]]. Probably means I should invest in a hard drive and find a way to store all my online presence where I have control over what info gets lost, not an arbitrary entity
> 
> ofc this might force me to not do [[twitter]] at all and just y'know write proper essays. but not me, i still need a [[time sink]] to distract me from the eternally approaching hell that is uni work.
> 
> honestly, the biggest problem with this account is that it's the long name for nobu hibiki, which is nobuga hibiki. nobuga just sounds so... not [[japanese]]. it's budget nobunaga
