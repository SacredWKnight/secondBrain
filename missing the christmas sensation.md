# missing the [[christmas]] sensation
https://twitter.com/nobu_hibiki/status/1336242204159791104

i dont celebrate christmas, but the "sensation" of christmas has always been part of my life. a time for [[contemplation]], a time to [[rest]], a time that signal [[restart]]. its really hard to get that vibe now. it seems like this december is just another month.

i tried listening to christmas songs, letting go of work, surrounding myself with things that remind me december, but none of it seems to be working. it feels so hard to do anything than just to... survive.

which is where i say that i am now simping [[gawrgura]]. this song in particular managed to make me goes "alright time to clean up my mess". i love my shark girl
