# [[Perfect world]] that is [[twitter roleplay]]
https://twitter.com/nobu_hibiki/status/1335871618191540226
basically have been spending the last three month in a sort of [[Cosmo Entelecheia]] (perfect world), also known as twt ocrp world. 

for those uninitiated, it is a side of twitter where people [[roleplay]] as characters, usually using a [[kpop]] idol as their visualization.

honestly, it's not that far off from what i usually do (which was [[dnd]]). the main difference is that instead of roleplaying as a character in a fantasy setting, you're roleplaying as a character in a sort of real world.

more akin to [[theater]], i got roped in due to a friend that said "if u want to experience [[dating]] u should try rp lol" and... yeah... that and more.

it's still going on. i'm still inhabiting that perfect world, but i think it's really interesting to see what it is i'm looking for in that world. at the moment, the thing that i have found a few points that will be useful for my real life.

1\. "dating" for me is not just about talking. in twtrp, there is only so much that you can do. sure you can \*imagine\* using things like /pats your head/ or write it out like you're writing a book. but it's all done through text and "visuals"

i think what i'm looking for is more of that [[non-verbal]] things, [[touches]], being [[comfortable in silence]], and something deeper. i'm not getting that (yet) here, maybe one day, but this basically cross out any need for me to use [[tinder]] during the [[pandemic]].

2\. really missing [[normalcy]] holy sheeeet am i using this as a cruch for real life. a me that is capable of doing normal shit like going to a cafe, hanging out with [[friends]], all those stuff. sure it's imagined, but i think i can manage not having the non verbal stuff for friends.

also just like, making friends. holy shit is making friends easy in rptwt. you just send a prompt to an account (base), the account then blast your prompt, and anyone who replies to that prompt automatically wants to be your friend

since everyone there is playing to have fun and make friends, there's no need to play all these theatrics to see if the other side is [[genuine]] or not. anyone not genuine wouldn't go through the hoops like this.

a common prompt might be something as simple as: "hi, my name is nobu and i'm 19. you wan't to be my friend" to something more complex like: "hi, i'm a economic student studying at xxx uni, i like try out instant noodles and spend most of my time playing the guitar"

something like that might exist in the real world, but the openness and emotional cost of making friends with your real face is so big that it probably wont work. if you just want friends to talk to, twtrp is very nice place to look for them.
