# Ketua BEM-UI
the strongest near [[future]]

- A few days ago, I wasn't able to sleep and I decided to "ciat-ciat" and the situation that I got was a *"what if I was Ketua BEM UI?"*
- Safe to say that is the closest situation I've felt of becoming a **prophet**.
- The image that I got from that night was one of the most vivid situation of all time. It felt like a message from god, literally *"ilham dari tuhan"*
- Like a message from the universe itself, it seemed to taunt me. *"This is what the future will look like if you keep up this energy level, now show me how you're gonna do it"*
- Scary shit man, before my goal was *"do a satire candidacy for cakabem because the uni politic is boring"* and now it's *"i will be the kabem and i shall create the start of a healthier education system, starting with intellectuals in university level"*
- Heck there's even extremely specific situation like
	- I'll talk with the rector
	- Gonna meet [[najwa shihab]] and be in **mata najwa**
	- Be a guest in [[deddy cobuzer]]'s podcast
	- Get yelled at by a female politician saying that "all i do is ask and criticize, where's the action?"
		- And the weird thing was how vivid it was. At that point my team was scared that I might lash out, but no. It was like a moment where I would surpass my limits and was able to answer well. The answer was something along the line of:
			- "Ya, saya setuju bu bahwa aksi itu penting. Walaupun begitu, sebagai mahasiswa, tugas kami adalah untuk belajar dan menyiapkan diri agar kami bisa memimpin dengan lebih baik. Bagaimana cara kami bisa memimpin dengan baik apabila kami tidak bertanya dan mengkritisi kejadian yang ada sekarang? 
			- 
			- Kritik tidak harus terjadi kepada mereka yang sudah berusaha untuk menjalankan Indonesia, namun kepada sistem dan kondisi yang sekarang kami rasakan dengan nyata. Kapan lagi kami bisa bertanya kalau bukan sekarang?"
	- I have a personal team to help me do the most with my time as Ketua BEM UI, and it includes
		- Legal person
		- Politic advisor/Copywriter
		- Personal Assistant
		- Videographer, which is very specifically [[ratri]].
			- I have ZERO CLUE why the image of [[ratri]] as my videographer was SO VIVID. 
- I'm still running as a *satire candidate*, but there was a specific manifesto that underlines it all.
	- **The Fundamentals of Education**.
		- BEM UI's goal for the next year is to ask why should we care about any of this, and what is the fundamental thing about uni.
		- This is done in turn through 3 discussion type.
			- **Expert talks:** Talking with experts and asking "what is education in Indonesia and why do we need to care about it, but like, no really fundamentally why is it important?"
			- **Inter-University discussion:** a long running discussion panel talking about the fundamentals of education and why university is necessary for them, pairing up representative from universities all over Indonesia (2 Uni per Island, 1 PTN with Akreditasi < B and 1 PTS)
			- **Open Focus Group Discussion:** an open discussion with me as the moderator talking about a specific issue in education.
		- And through a push from kastrat creating content that asks about education in their own personal experience.
		- Other than that I personally as Ketua BEM UI will be running live streams sessions in order to start discussion, allowing people to come and discuss topics outside of education that might be important.
	- Other things that was important
		- I DO NOT care about [[optics]].
			- This doesn't mean cursing, but it does mean transparency and an open view of why we are doing things.
			- I'm here to serve the deeper philosophical problems in university, so I will put the "effective" things that the populous might want in the back burner
				- i.e. the lowering of the UKT. There will be discourse on why it is important, but I personally do not want to say with a definite yes that that is what is important
					- Part of this is asking Rektorat to open up their financial statement so that we are able to discuss this with all data
						- With sentiments such as *"kami ingin membuat keputusan berdasarkan data"*
		- Demo is a no longer an important part of Kastrat
			- We will advocate for demonstrations through other movement
			- Demo should be a time for policy, but also for discussion on what we are really demoing about
- It is a weird experience, and this is me just trying to dump it all. I think it might have been spiritual in nature.
- Idk how to move forward, other than to keep up the energy and let the world runs it's course.
