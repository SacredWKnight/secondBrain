> CONTEXT: it was J-nee from [[twitter roleplay]]

am in a terrible mood state from last night. was waiting for a call with a friend who am I guess kinda is fighting (more that i made em cross) and have been in a constant state of anxiety over what is going to happen.

woke up at 5 after waiting for them to answer, nothing new. slept again, i imagined them answering me in one way, woken up, was just a dream. repeat this process 5 times and oh boy does that reveal a lot of [[internal wish]] and [[expectations]].

i really am not sure how to tackle [[friendships]] deeper than medium level. you know, ones that touches the soul. i thought that opening up my most [[vulnerable]] part would be the way to go but it just hasn't panned out well. not sure how to handle more of it tbh

there is ofc a way to be open with the deepest secret and not suffer from the above, and that is to not give a fuck what other thinks. but it is really, really scary to think that I'm cutting off feedback and information from the outside world about who i am.
