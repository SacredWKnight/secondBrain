today post laundry brain juice is me imagining a [[successful route]] of me confessing and asking my crush out. weird start with me accidentally blurting out how i feel in the cafeteria loudly, followed by her confronting me about that like a week later

situation was probably in half a year to a year from now? we're probably closer due to a few class together, bcz she confronted me after a learning session.

is wishful [[daydreaming]], but also kinda a scenario creation where i'm prepping myself for what i would do IF said thing happened. likely hood small, still good to create [[scenarios]] for

also added benefit that i feel better about myself lol
